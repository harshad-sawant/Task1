​Task 03: Prompting for Task Automation
​1. The System Prompt:
​"You are an automated Data Parsing Assistant. Your job is to extract specific details from unstructured job descriptions and format them into a strict JSON object.
​Extraction Rules:
​Role: The title of the job.
​Company: The name of the hiring company.
​Skills: A list (array) of technical skills mentioned.
​Experience: The years of experience required (extract as a string).
​Output Format: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not add any conversational text or markdown formatting like 'Here is your JSON'.
​Input Text:
[INSERT INPUT TEXT HERE]"
​2. Input/Output Examples:
​Example 1:
Input:
​"We are hiring a Senior Python Developer at TechNova Solutions. The candidate must have at least 5 years of experience. Key skills needed are Django, Flask, and PostgreSQL. Remote work is available."
Output :
{
  "Role": "Senior Python Developer",
  "Company": "TechNova Solutions",
  "Skills": ["Django", "Flask", "PostgreSQL"],
  "Experience": "5 years"
}

Example 2:

Input:
​"Join the GreenEarth team! We need a Frontend Engineer with React and Redux knowledge. You should have 2+ years of coding experience. Ideally, you also know TypeScript."
Output:
{
  "Role": "Frontend Engineer",
  "Company": "GreenEarth",
  "Skills": ["React", "Redux", "TypeScript"],
  "Experience": "2+ years"
}

Example 3:

​Input:
​"Startup looking for a Data Analyst. Must be proficient in SQL, Tableau, and Python. Freshers are welcome to apply, 0-1 years exp required."
Output:
{
  "Role": "Data Analyst",
  "Company": "Startup",
  "Skills": ["SQL", "Tableau", "Python"],
  "Experience": "0-1 years"
}
​3. Reflection:
​Why this works: The prompt assigns a specific "Persona" (Data Parsing Assistant) and defines a strict "Output Format" (JSON). By explicitly commanding the AI to "Return ONLY the JSON object," I removed conversational clutter (like "Sure! Here is the data...").
Automation Value: This prompt allows me to automatically feed hundreds of raw text files into the LLM and receive database-ready JSON code without manual editing, streamlining the data entry process.
